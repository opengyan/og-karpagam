1) Given an array of jobs where every job has a deadline and associated profit if the job is finished before the deadline. 
It is also given that every job takes one day to finish and therefore, the minimum possible deadline for any job is 1. 
How to maximize total profit if only one job can be scheduled on a day.

Example :
Input: Four Jobs with following deadlines and profits
  JobID    Deadline      Profit
    a        4            20   
    b        1            10
    c        1            40  
    d        1            30
Output: Following is maximum profit sequence of jobs
        c, a


2) Given a text, generate huffman code for it.
Input:
A greedy algorithm is an algorithm that follows the problem solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum. In many problems, a greedy strategy does not in general produce an optimal solution, but nonetheless a greedy heuristic may yield locally optimal solutions that approximate a global optimal solution in a reasonable time.
